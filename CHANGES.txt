3.7.4 (2012-02-01)
------------------

- Added explicit tests for escaping introduced in 3.7.3.

- Handing names of classes those string representation cannot
  be determined as untrusted input thus escaping them in error reports.

- Fixed tests on Python 2.4 and 2.5.

3.7.3 (2012-01-17)
------------------

- Escape untrusted input before constructing HTML for error reporting.

3.7.2 (2010-10-30)
------------------

- Set ``copy_to_zlog`` by default to 1/True.
  Having it turned off is a small problem, because fatal (startup) errors
  will not get logged anywhere.


3.7.1 (2010-09-25)
------------------

- Added test extra to declare test dependency on ``zope.testing``.


3.7.0 (2009-09-29)
------------------

- Cleaned up dependencies. Droped all testing dependencies as we only need
  zope.testing now.

- Fixed ImportError when zope.testing is not available for some reason.

- Removed zcml slug and old zpkg-related files.

- Removed word "version" from changelog entries.

- Changed package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired. Also changed `cheeseshop` to
  `pypi` in the package's homepage url.

- Added dependency on ZODB3 as we use Persistent.

- Used a mock request for testing. Dropped the dependency on zope.publisher
  which was really only a testing dependency.

- Reduced the dependency on zope.container to one on zope.location by no
  longer using the Contained mix-in class.

3.6.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container

- Move error log bootstrapping logic (which was untested) to
  ``zope.app.appsetup``, to which we added a test.

3.5.1 (2007-09-27)
------------------

- rebumped to replace faulty egg

3.5.0
-----

- Initial documented release

- Moved core components from ``zope.app.error`` to this package.
